This repo contains my opinions about using machine learning in healthcare, specifically when the goal is to supplement or replace the judgment of healthcare providers.

When I was working at Verily, I attended an AI in healthcare conference. During one of the panel discussions, a panelist expressed the belief that "If my model has a good AUC, doctors should just use it". I was deeply distrubed by that comment because it exposed a lack of understanding of the myriad of ways that machine learning fails in the real world. I found the lack of pushback from other panelists even more distressing.

That experience caused me to raise these concerns with my clinical and data science colleagues at Verily. I ended up writing what I personally thought should be the process that a team should go through before a machine learning model is used for clinical decision support. Additionally, I was invited to speak at the Harvard Medical School Clinical Informatics Lecture Series in April of 2018, where I discussed how "Machine Learning isn't Magic"
